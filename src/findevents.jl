    findtextevents(eventtype, track)
Find all text events specifield by `eventtype` in the `track`.
The `eventtype` can be `TextEvent, LyricEvent, MarkerEvent, which will find the
appropriate meta events.

For convenience, this function does not return the events themselves.
Instead, it returns three vectors: the first is the strings of the events,
the second is the indices of the events in the `track` and the third is
the absolute position of the events (since start of `track`).

*Notice* - common music score editors like e.g. MuseScore, GuitarPro, etc., do
not export the lyrics and text information when exporting midi files.

*Notice* - Cubase can read the marker events and MuseScore can read the lyrics
events. We haven't seen any editor that can read the text events, so far.
